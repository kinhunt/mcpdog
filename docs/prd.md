# MCPDog Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

This PRD outlines the requirements for significant enhancements to the MCPDog project aimed at improving stability and reducing bugs. The analysis and requirements herein are based on the comprehensive `brownfield-architecture.md` document generated on 2025-08-15.

### 1.1. Existing Project Overview

- **Analysis Source**: The primary source for this PRD is the `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` document, which was created via an IDE-based fresh analysis of the project.
- **Current Project State**: MCPDog is a functional MCP server proxy and manager. It successfully routes tool calls between clients and various MCP servers. However, as identified in the architecture document, there are areas with known technical debt and potential instability.

### 1.2. Available Documentation Analysis

- **Available Documentation**: A comprehensive architecture document now exists.
- **Checklist**:
    - [x] Tech Stack Documentation
    - [x] Source Tree/Architecture
    - [ ] Coding Standards (partially inferred)
    - [x] API Documentation (partially inferred)
    - [ ] External API Documentation
    - [ ] UX/UI Guidelines
    - [x] Technical Debt Documentation
    - [ ] Other:

### 1.3. Enhancement Scope Definition

- **Enhancement Type**:
    - [ ] New Feature Addition
    - [ ] Major Feature Modification
    - [ ] Integration with New Systems
    - [x] Performance/Scalability Improvements
    - [ ] UI/UX Overhaul
    - [ ] Technology Stack Upgrade
    - [x] Bug Fix and Stability Improvements
- **Enhancement Description**: This initiative focuses on improving the overall stability, reliability, and maintainability of the MCPDog application by addressing known technical debt, improving error handling, and increasing test coverage.
- **Impact Assessment**:
    - [ ] Minimal Impact
    - [x] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)
    - [ ] Significant Impact
    - [ ] Major Impact

### 1.4. Goals and Background Context

- **Goals**:
    - Reduce the number of unhandled exceptions and silent failures.
    - Improve the developer experience for debugging and troubleshooting.
    - Increase confidence in the stability of core modules.
    - Address critical technical debt before it becomes a major blocker.
- **Background Context**: The initial development of MCPDog focused on delivering core proxying functionality. As the system has matured, several areas of technical debt and inconsistent patterns have emerged. Proactively addressing these issues will ensure the long-term health and scalability of the project.

### 1.5. Change Log

| Change                      | Date       | Version | Description         | Author    |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| Initial Draft               | 2025-08-15 | 1.0     | First draft of PRD. | John (PM) |

## 2. Requirements

_(These requirements are based on the analysis of the existing system and are intended as a starting point for review.)_

### 2.1. Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system shall implement structured, context-aware logging in all core modules (`core/`, `router/`, `daemon/`).
- **FR2**: The error handling in the `StdioMCPServer` shall be improved to always return a valid MCP error response to the client upon failure.
- **FR3**: The known inconsistent coding patterns (e.g., callbacks vs. promises) in the `userService` (hypothetically, as an example of a core service) shall be refactored to use a single, consistent async/await pattern.
- **FR4**: The system must provide a mechanism to detect and gracefully handle the failure of a downstream MCP server without crashing the main MCPDog process.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1**: The addition of enhanced logging must not increase average request latency by more than 10%.
- **NFR2**: All refactoring must be accompanied by corresponding unit or integration tests.
- **NFR3**: The project's overall test coverage should increase by at least 20%.

### 2.3. Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1**: All changes must maintain backward compatibility with the existing `mcpdog.config.json` structure.
- **CR2**: The public-facing REST API for the web dashboard must not contain breaking changes.
- **CR3**: The CLI commands and their arguments must remain backward compatible.

## 3. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

This section is a summary of the findings in `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`.

- **Existing Technology Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Socket.io. No changes to the core stack are planned.
- **Integration Approach**: All changes will be internal to the MCPDog codebase. No new external integrations are required.
- **Code Organization and Standards**: All new code and refactoring should follow the existing file structure and inferred naming conventions (e.g., `-manager.ts`, `-server.ts`).
- **Deployment and Operations**: The existing `npm run build` and publish process will not be changed.
- **Risk Assessment**: The primary risk is introducing regressions while refactoring core components. This will be mitigated by adding comprehensive tests before and after changes. The known issue with `@playwright/mcp` is noted but will not be addressed in this epic.

---

## 4. Epic and Story Structure

- **Epic Approach**: This enhancement will be structured as a single, comprehensive epic focused on stability and maintainability. This allows for a coordinated effort to improve the codebase's health.

---

## 5. Epic 1: System Stability and Maintainability Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: To refactor and harden core components of the MCPDog application, reduce technical debt, improve error handling, and increase test coverage to create a more stable and maintainable platform.

### Story 1.1: Implement Structured Logging
> As a developer, I want structured, context-aware logging implemented across all core services, so that I can debug issues more efficiently and understand the application flow.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. A logging utility is created or an existing one (e.g., `logging/server-log-manager.ts`) is enhanced.
    2. All methods in `MCPDogServer` and `ToolRouter` have entry/exit logs.
    3. All error-catching blocks log the full error with context.
    4. Log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR) are used appropriately.

### Story 1.2: Refactor StdioServer Error Handling
> As an MCP client developer, I want the `StdioMCPServer` to always return a valid MCP error response when a request fails, so that my client application can handle the error gracefully.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. Review all `try...catch` blocks in `src/index.ts`.
    2. Ensure that any caught error results in a `sendMessage` call with a valid MCPResponse containing an `error` object.
    3. Add a test case that simulates a processing error and asserts that the correct error response is sent to stdout.

### Story 1.3: Increase Integration Test Coverage
> As a developer, I want to increase the integration test coverage for the `ToolRouter`, so that I can refactor it with confidence and prevent regressions in tool routing logic.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. New integration tests are added to `vitest`.
    2. Tests cover scenarios like tool name conflicts, server disconnections, and enabling/disabling tools.
    3. The overall test coverage for `src/router/tool-router.ts` increases measurably.

## 6. Out of Scope

- Adding any new user-facing features.
- Changing the UI of the web dashboard.
- Addressing the `@playwright/mcp` compatibility issue.
- Upgrading major dependencies (e.g., Node, Express).

---

## 7. Open Questions

- What are the most common or critical bugs currently affecting users?
- Is there a specific module or component that is considered the most fragile?
